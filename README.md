## **Inspiration: Solving the Issues in the Agricultural Supply Chain**

Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the economy of many countries, especially in developing nations like India, where farmers face enormous challenges. Traditional farming practices, low profit margins, and the involvement of numerous intermediaries in the supply chain often leave farmers with little financial gain. Intermediaries drive up costs for consumers while simultaneously cutting into farmers' profits.

**AgroBazaar** aims to disrupt this inefficient cycle by providing a direct-to-market platform for farmers and bulk buyers. The platform connects farmers to buyers such as wholesalers, retail markets, and other bulk consumers, removing unnecessary intermediaries, ensuring fairer prices for farmers, and ultimately improving the supply chain for all parties involved.

## **What AgroBazaar Does: A Bridge Between Farmers and Buyers**

**AgroBazaar** is an online platform designed to facilitate direct transactions between farmers and bulk buyers. Through this platform, farmers can list their agricultural products, set their own prices, and connect with buyers who can purchase in bulk. By cutting out the middlemen, the platform allows farmers to retain more profit from their crops.

Additionally, the platform offers features such as **real-time market data**, **crop tracking**, and **buyer trends**, providing farmers with valuable insights to make better decisions about crop production, marketing, and sales.

## **Development Approach: Building the AgroBazaar Platform**

The **AgroBazaar** platform was developed using **Java** and **JSP** technologies. For the backend, we used **Servlets** and **JDBC** for database interaction, and **MySQL** to store user data, product listings, and transaction records.

The platform is structured in a modular way, with clear separation between the model, controller, and view layers, following the **MVC** architecture for better maintainability and scalability. Key components include:

- **Buyer Registration & Login:** Secure login and registration functionality for buyers to create accounts and access the platform's features.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admin functionality to manage user registrations, product listings, and oversee transactions.
- **Product Listings:** Farmers can add their products, set prices, and view buyer demands.

In addition, the project includes a well-structured **Database Connection** module, ensuring stable interaction between the platform and the database. The **Product** and **User** beans ensure smooth data transfer across the application.
